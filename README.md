# E-banking
Android application for bank management 

Description : mobile-banking is an android application used in banking management, with this app, you can consulte your amount, 
transfer money to another person, currency balence and other many other functionalities.

Technologies used : I created the application with Java (logic of the app) and XML (UI of the app), for data i used also MySQL and PHP, 
you have to use PHP because in android app you need to run a server to perform data (add , delete, modify, â€¦). 
I also used a Currency API to show the currency exchange rate in the world.
